Chal: Return the flag from this encrypted image to Americas [first female cryptanalyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzzAnvsIOnc)

## Solution

Flag has been encoded with AES-ECB. Just copy back the header and the flag will still be visible.

```python
with open('flag_example.bmp', 'rb') as png_header:
    header_bytes = png_header.read(100)

with open('flag.enc', 'rb') as encrypted_file:
    encrypted_bytes = encrypted_file.read()

with open('flag-recovered.bmp', 'wb') as output_file:
    output_file.write(header_bytes) # header
    output_file.write(encrypted_bytes[8:]) # 9th byte on to end
```

Alternatively, you could use ``dd`` to copy the 100 header bytes

```
dd if=flag.bmp bs=1 count=100 of=flag.enc conv=notrunc
```
