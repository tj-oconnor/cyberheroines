## Prompt

[Grace Brewster Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this theory was later extended to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. - [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)
