# Radia Perlman

## Prompt

[Radia Joy Perlman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman) (/ˈreɪdiə/;[1] born December 18, 1951) is an American computer programmer and network engineer. She is a major figure in assembling the networks and technology to enable what we now know as the internet. She is most famous for her invention of the spanning-tree protocol (STP), which is fundamental to the operation of network bridges, while working for Digital Equipment Corporation, thus earning her nickname "Mother of the Internet". Her innovations have made a huge impact on how networks self-organize and move data. She also made large contributions to many other areas of network design and standardization: for example, enabling today's link-state routing protocols, to be more robust, scalable, and easy to manage. - [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman)
