The link requires document.cookie to be replaced with MD5(cyberheroineusername) in the Console on inspecting Request Help button 
and then reloding gives the flag. MD5(cyberheroineusername) is made not guessy by giving a clue that makes it obvious that it is
  MD5 and we should use the string cyberheroineusername. I can make change here too to make it not guessy if it needs improvement.
