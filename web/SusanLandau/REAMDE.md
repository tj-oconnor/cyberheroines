## Solution

The link requires document.cookie to be replaced with MD5(cyberheroineusername) in the Console on inspecting Request Help button 
and then reloding gives the flag. MD5(cyberheroineusername) is made not guessy by giving a clue that makes it obvious that it is
  MD5 and we should use the string cyberheroineusername. I can make change here too to make it not guessy if it needs improvement.
